# Knapsack Problem
Imagine that you are a thief breaking into a house. There are so many valuables to steal, but you’re just one person who can only carry so much. Each item has a weight and value, and your goal is to maximize the total value of items while remaining within the weight limit of your knapsack. Implement a `knapsack()` function or method in either ***Java*** or ***Javascript*** takes in:

* the total amount of weight you can carry
* an array of the weights of all the items
* an array of the values of all of the items

and returns the maximum value that you will be able to carry.

For example, let’s say your knapsack can carry `10` units of weight. The item weights are `[3, 6, 8]` and their values are `[50, 60, 100]`. Your knapsack function should return `110` since you can carry the first and second items, whose values total `110`. If you tried to carry the third item, which has a value of `100`, you wouldn’t be able to fit anything else in the knapsack.

Please place your code in the `src` directory and add a `RUNME.md` file with instructions on how to compile/run your code.

**Hint:** Since this position involves testing, we are looking for how you implement the above problem and how you test it.
