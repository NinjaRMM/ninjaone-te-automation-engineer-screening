**Weather API Testing**
API /v1/weather

Acording to the requirements shown in the README.md document the following test cases will be as listed below:
Happy path
1.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city
2.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by zip code
3.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by latitude and longitude
4.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city and state
5.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city and country
6.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city, state and country

Assertions for this api: 
Status code 200
Validate Json response contains variables: cloud_pct,temp,feels_like,humidity,min_temp,max_temp,wind_speed,wind_degrees,sunrise,sunset 
Validate Json response contains variables with corresponding data type: 
cloud_pct (string),temp (int),feels_like (int),humidity (string),min_temp (int),max_temp (int),wind_speed (string),
wind_degrees (string),sunrise (string),sunset (string)
Validate json sunrise and sunset variables are with date time and timezone format

Negative path
1.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city and zip code
2.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by zip code and latitud/longitude 
3.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by latitude/longitude, country and state
4.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city, state and latitud/longitude
5.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city, country and latitud/longitude
6.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city, state, country and latitud/longitude
7.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by city, state, country, zip code and latitud/longitude
8.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by zip code, state and latitud/longitude 
9.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by zip code, country and latitud/longitude 
10.- HTTP GET method obtain the weather by zip code, state, country and latitud/longitude 

Assertions for this api: 
Status code 500/400 Acording design.
